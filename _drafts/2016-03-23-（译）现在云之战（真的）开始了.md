Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, presciently once said, “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.”  While a seemingly absurd notion on the surface, it’s becoming a reality that’s all too likely as we move into the cloud computing era.  
IBM的创始人Thomas Watson曾经有预见性地说过：“我认为世界可能只需要5台计算机”。一个表面看似荒谬的见解，但随着我们进入云计算时代，它正在变成一个非常有可能的现实。


After years of investing in their own server farms, software stacks, middleware, disaster recovery systems, security solutions, and networking, technology companies and non-technology companies alike are recognizing that their commitments of time and money never got them the differentiation they wanted.  
经过多年投资自己的服务器集群、软件栈、中间件、灾难恢复系统、安全解决方案和网络，科技和非科技公司都认识到这些投入的时间和金钱从未带来它们想要的竞争力差异。


Nearly every business in the world –from GE and Coke to small businesses– had to replicate millions of computers around the world to all perform nearly the same tasks. Few companies had the right technical talent and know-how to do any of these tasks efficiently, and fewer still could achieve the economies of scale necessary to make these investments cost-effective.  
几乎世界上每一个企业，从通用、可口可乐到小公司，在世界范围内重复部署了数百万台计算机来完成几乎一样的任务。很少有公司拥有适合的技术人才并且知道如何高效地完成这些任务，而更少有公司能够让这些投资达到符合必要成本效益的规模经济。


Today — like Watson envisioned — we now see a time when only five to ten “computers” (or clouds) may operate with enough volume to compete on price and performance. And the companies vying to be one of those five or ten computers are some of the largest on the planet.  
今天，正如Watson预见到的，我们现在看见的这个时代可能只会有5到10台计算机（或是云），它们能够运营到足够大的规模来进行价格和性能的竞争。并且竞争成为这5或10家之一的公司们会是这个星球上最大的一些公司。


For all of the the rapid adoption of SaaS applications in the enterprise thus far, the cloud is, remarkably, still in its infancy. In many ways, we’re looking at the PC market in 1983, smartphone market in 2003, or the search market in 1998.  
对于当前企业快速采用 SaaS（软件即服务）应用的现状，云计算显然还处在起步的婴儿期。从许多方面看，这就像1983年的PC市场，2003年的智能手机市场，或者1998年的搜索市场。

The undisputed leader in the space, which just celebrated its 10 year anniversary, only commands a $10 billion run-rate in cloud revenue; compare that to the trillions of dollars spent globally across all of enterprise IT, and you can tell we’re just getting started.  
在这个领域毫无争议的领导者刚刚庆祝了它的10周年纪念日，虽然AWS运营收入有[100亿美元](http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/20/now-the-cloud-wars-really-begin/?ncid=rss)，但相比万亿的市场规模，你该明白我们这才刚刚开始。


For all of the back-and-forth between Microsoft, Amazon,  Google and others over the past couple of years, we’ve only seen the most nascent battles in a multi-decade war for the future of the cloud.  
过去数年间，微软、亚马逊、谷歌和其他一些公司之间的来回拉锯争夺，我们仅仅看到了未来数十年云战争最初的战斗而已。


In hindsight, Amazon kicking off the cloud wars isn’t as unlikely as it seemed at the time. Most reacted to Amazon’s Web Services initiative as an intriguing experiment by the online bookseller, but certainly not fit for anyone but hobbyists and individual developers; as then-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer put it simply, “[Amazon doesn’t] have much experience selling to big companies.”  
事后看来，开启云战争的亚马逊在当时似乎并非是没可能的。大多数人认为AWS是一个网上书店发起的有趣实验，只适合爱好者和个人开发者，肯定不会适用于所有人。之后微软CEO [Steve Ballmer](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/steve-ballmer-maps-microsofts-cloud-y-future/?_r=0)简单地说道：“亚马逊缺乏向大公司销售的经验。”


But what Amazon did have was precisely what big companies needed in their computing — scale. Amazon was one of the few companies in the world to have served the masses over the web, and thus could offer both technically and economically attractive services to developers without breaking a sweat. This was an unexpected advantage at first, and pretty soon the industry recognized something different was happening in the war for computing.  
但是亚马逊确实拥有大公司在计算上所需要的东西——规模和弹性。亚马逊是世界上提供大规模web服务的少数公司之一，所以它能毫不费力地提供技术和经济上有吸引力的服务。起初这是一个未曾意料到的优势，之后很快业界认识到在计算之争中一些不同的事情正在发生。


What followed are the various twists and turns that occur in any new industry just starting to take form, with many players entering and exiting throughout.  
在一个新行业的成型过程中随之而来的是各种各样的迂回曲折，伴随着许多玩家的进入与退出。


Amazon, like any good first-mover, reliably delivered more capabilities, at lower prices, in more regions, and just kept gobbling up more of the market. However, when we focus on the missteps or false starts of players like Google or Microsoft as they’ve been getting their cloud DNA in order, we forget these are generation-long wars, and we’ve barely seen what’s in store for any of the players.  
亚马逊，像任何优秀的先行者一样，以更低的价格在更多的地区提供了越来越多的可靠的服务，并还在不断吞噬更多的市场份额。然而当我们把注意力放在像谷歌或微软这些玩家的失误或出师不利上时，他们正在调整自身的云基因，我们忘了这可是一代漫长的战争，目下我们还几乎看不到这些玩家可供出售的服务。


Case in point, on an otherwise normal weekday in November, it was casually announced that Diane Greene, VMware’s founding CEO, was coming on board to lead Google’s cloud efforts.  
一个例子，十一月一个普通的工作日，谷歌低调地宣布Diane Greene（VMware的创始CEO）将加入并领导谷歌云相关的工作。


Overnight, Google unlocked their un-matched technical arsenal –driven by years of success building out Google Search, Gmail, Youtube, Maps– with one of the most important individuals in software today.  
一夜之间，谷歌解锁了他们无与伦比的技术军火库（这套武器是在成功构建谷歌搜索、Gmail、Youtube、谷歌地图的过程中经历数年发展起来的）并拥有了今天软件界最重要的个人之一。


Now with the right leadership in place, Google can solve many of the missing aspects of their cloud efforts: packaging up the right technology offerings, building out a broader developer ecosystem, and having the patience to work with slower-moving organizations.  
现在有了正确的领导，谷歌能解决许多云工作上缺失的方面：包装正确的技术产品，构建出更广阔的开发者生态，并且拥有耐心和行动缓慢的组织合作。


Even in a matter of weeks, it was rumored that Apple may be quietly moving to the Google platform, and Spotify has made the leap as well.  
甚至在几周内，有传言[苹果可能悄悄的转移到谷歌平台](http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/16/apple-looks-to-googles-cloud-platform-as-it-diversifies-its-infrastructure/)，同时[Spotify也取得了飞跃的进展](https://news.spotify.com/us/2016/02/23/announcing-spotify-infrastructures-googley-future/)。


Starting in 2016, the real battles will commence.  
从2016开始，真正的战斗即将打响。


## Clouds in Multiple Flavors 多种口味的云
The first phase of this war will be fought based primarily on pricing and performance. Even looking over the past few years, Amazon has cut its price 44 times to stay competitive as well as pre-empt new entrants. Google, earlier last year announced that its prices would continue to fall at the rate of Moore’s Law, signaling there’s no end in sight for how low they’ll go. These are just a few of the tactical pricing assaults that will be launched as the world’s workloads transition from on-prem to the cloud.  
这场战争的第一阶段将主要基于价格和性能。即使回顾过去几年，亚马逊已降价44次以保持竞争力并阻止新进入者。谷歌去年早些时候宣布，它的价格将随摩尔定律持续下降，暗示了降价没有结束的迹象。这只是一些即将推出的将全球工作负载从企业内部迁移到云上的战术定价攻击。


But the next phase is where the cloud will get really interesting.   
但接下来的阶段，云将变得真正有趣起来。


Competing on price is a game that any business strategist laments, and the big players in the cloud are no exception. Over the coming years, we’ll begin to see how each cloud intends to drive differentiation, as selling commoditized infrastructure is only fun for so long. And this is where the various DNAs of each player become most instructive.   
价格竞争是一个让任何企业战略家哀叹的游戏，云战争中的大玩家们也不例外。之后几年，我们将会开始看到每一个云玩家如何去推动差异化竞争，因为销售商品化的基础设施只能玩这么久。并且这正是每个玩家各异的DNA变得最有指导意义的地方。


For Microsoft, that margin will come from premium enterprise software and services, and driving more and more synergies between its combined offerings. For IBM, we’ll likely see enhanced value driven by their depth of industry-specific solutions, consulting, and cognitive computing efforts. For Google it’ll likely come down to cost advantages and hard-to-replicate tech that they’ve mastered for years.    
对微软而言，利润来自于优质的企业软件和服务，并且推动其组合产品之间越来越多的协同效应。对IBM而言，我们很可能会看到其在特定行业解决方案，咨询和认知计算方面的工作带来的价值增值。对谷歌而言，可能会归结于它的成本优势和已经掌握多年的[难以复制的技术](http://venturebeat.com/2015/12/09/google-cloud-cdn/)。


Amazon will likely find itself in a spot not too foreign to its core business, by competing with  low cost offerings and a wide selection of services. Sound familiar? Finally, we’ll see committed efforts by players like Oracle and even possibly dark horses like Facebook, who will equally design their own models to suit their business.   
亚马逊很可能会发现自己在一个相比于核心业务并不陌生的点上，通过低成本的产品和可供广泛选择的多种服务来竞争。听起来是不是很熟悉？最后，我们将看到像甲骨文甚至可能的黑马如Facebook等这些玩家的坚持不懈，它们都将同样设计自己的模式来满足它们的业务。


This is not a winner-takes-all game, but it will be an aggressive battle for the hearts and minds of every developer and enterprise on the planet.  
这不是一个赢家通吃的游戏，但它会是一场侵略战争，致力于占领这个星球上每个开发者和企业的心灵与头脑。


What we do know is computing costs will continue to drop by orders of magnitude and offerings will be launched to solve some of the most fringe but vexing problems in IT. The cloud wars are only beginning.  
我们所知道的是计算成本将继续以数量级的方式下降，而解决一些边缘但棘手的IT问题的产品和服务将被推出。云战争才刚刚开始。
